# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## 🧾 Program
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output
![517705647-204f63ec-7a63-4ca6-a1cf-b059afae84cb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1d3cf64-4336-4295-a02c-230f1678abb7)
